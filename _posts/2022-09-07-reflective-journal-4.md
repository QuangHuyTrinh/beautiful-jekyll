For this week’s topic, I want to discuss the recent Career Festival held by RMIT and my experience with it. The festival was held on the 15th of August and lasted for 3 weeks. During those 3 weeks, I was able to educate myself on how to choose the right path for my career, the process of applying for a job in a company, create a desirable job application, the process of job interviews and how to succeed in them. I also got a chance to meet with IT industry leaders in Vietnam and talked about what they want in a potential employee.

In the first week, I got to attend multiple workshops that were designed to help students identify their career of choice, then briefed them with the essential knowledge to become employable. The first workshop I attended was about career orientation. For me, I have a passion for everything tech related ever since I was handed my first electronic device, which is a Gameboy Advance. From that moment onward, I know that my future career would have to be in the tech industry. And the counselor in charge of assisting me that day also agreed.

In the second week, I got to do mock interviews with HR personnel from various industry partners of RMIT. Even though they were labeled as “mock”, the atmosphere and the questions given to the interviewee were identical to the ones that they would use in an actual interview with a potential employee, which made me quite nervous at first. My first and second mock interview were terrible. However, I got a lot of valuable feedback from those interviews on how to calm my nervousness, which caused me to stumble on my words trying to answer questions from the interviewer. On my third one, I still made many minor mistakes, like not making enough eye contact and making unnecessary hand gestures, but my major weakness of being extremely nervous was mostly gone.

In the third week, I got a chance to meet with the creator of Grab, a multi-service app like Uber and how he got it to become the industry leading software like it is today. As it turns out, not every application needs to be state-of-the-art to be successful.

In summary, I believe that my experience at the Career Festival in RMIT has helped me prepare myself better for the job market.
