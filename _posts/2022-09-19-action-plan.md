title: Action Plan
---
After the experience I’ve described and reflected in the previous weeks, I would like to introduce my action plan that will help me become a better student in the School of Science and Technology at RMIT and a desirable employee in the job market. The first year will be about improving my self study and teamwork skill. The second year will cover my additional studies outside of what will be taught at RMIT. The third year will be about building connections with people in the tech industry. My final year will be entirely about learning through internship with different companies.

As I have established in my reflection #2, as a future software developer, I would have to constantly interact and work with my fellow employees on multiple projects. Learning the necessary skills to make the working process go as smooth as possible is a must. Therefore, I would like to spend my first year doing team projects and collaborating with as many different people as I can to familiarize myself with multiple different scenarios that might come up in the workplace in future. I’d also visit the library more often to have a discussion with the librarian there about how to get the best of my time doing my own study.

In my second year, using the self study skills I’d acquired during the first year, I’d like to learn more about different systems that companies used in their day-to-day work as well as others programming language that can diversify my career choices.

In my third year, I’d like to go and meet people in the tech industry via tech conferences or personal connections. This way I will get to find out more about the current trend in the industry and have some time to integrate them into my learning.

In my final year, I will try to get internships for different companies in the industries to get to know how they work and compare them to one another. From there, I would be able to identify which working environment is best suited for me.
