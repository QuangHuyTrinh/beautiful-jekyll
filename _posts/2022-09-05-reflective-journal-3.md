For this week’s topic, I want to talk about my experience learning a programming language on my own. The language that I chose was Python because I heard it was one of the easiest programming languages to start with if you don’t have any prior programming experience. My study material of choice was the video “Learn Python – Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]” from freeCodeCamp.org, which is one of the largest NPOs that teaches people how to code for free. 

The first thing I noticed about learning a new programming language was the ease of access to everything a complete beginner will need. Every required softwares are available to download for free on the Internet. In my case, all I needed to do was install the language Python and an IDE like PyCharm on my computer. 

During the course, I got to learn about simple commands like print(“”) and input (“”) to use in my program. I also got to learn about statements that can be used to filter the desired results like if then and statements that can “loop” a piece of code multiple times like the for loops. In between every lesson, I was tasked to build a simple program that utilize a command or statement that I’ve learned previously to seee some practical uses of it.

After finishing the course, I was surprised at how readable most of the commands are. The commands are written in plain English and do the thing that they’re called. For example, the print(“”) command prints out the text inside the double quotes. Because of this, the user can usually guess the function of a command even if they’ve never used that command before in their programs. Addditionally, the code written Python is organized very neatly. I tried to look up a similar program in C++ to see if I could understand it and the result was unsurprising impossible. In C++ they use symbols a lot more than Python, so people who are not familiar with the meanings of every symbol in the language will have a much harder time guessing what they do in the program.

In summary, my experience learning a new programming language has been a wonderful one. I will use the experience I’ve got from this to try to apply to my future studies, namely other popular programming languages.
