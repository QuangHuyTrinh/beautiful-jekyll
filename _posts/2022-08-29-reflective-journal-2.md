For this week’s topic, I want to talk about my discussion with a senior in the same program as mine. I was introduced to him via my friend. He’s currently at the end of his 3rd year, so I was confident that with his experience, he can give me more than adequate answers to my questions.

My first question for him was about the difficulty of the courses at higher levels. He explained that if I’ve got a firm grasp of the fundamentals at lower levels, I should be doing fine later as well, since most of the courses are built upon your understanding of the fundamentals. However, if you can’t grasp the basics in the first two years, it would be very difficult for you to understand the materials since they won’t be repeating information that has previously been introduced earlier in the program. Upon hearing this, I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking to myself that I was so lucky to be able to know about this beforehand.

My second question was about his experience in team projects throughout his studies. He answered that while knowing a lot about the subject of the group work is going to help, it’s mostly the part where you work with your fellow teammates that counts. He mentioned that working in the industry requires a lot of collaboration and communication between every member in the team. Therefore, he told me to utilize every chance I can get in my early years to practice working with others while the scope of the project is still small.

My third and final question was about his method of finding study materials. He admitted that most of his learning materials were from the school’s library since the resources over there are already plentiful and high quality enough. He also said that if I ever need to find a specific material, I can ask the librarians there to help. For research, in addition to the library, he also used Google Scholar to find peer-reviewed papers. 

In summary, my brief discussion with a senior student proved to be a valuable experience for me. Through him, I got to know how I should plan my studies throughout the program, take every chance I get to practice working with different types of people and find quality study material.
